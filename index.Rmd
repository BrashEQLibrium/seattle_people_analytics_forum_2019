- Suppose it's back at the end of 2018
- We had three job requisitions open at any point that year:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
end2017 <- as.Date("2017-12-31")
end2018 <- as.Date("2018-12-31")
toyexample <- tibble::tribble(
  ~`Requisition ID`,    ~`Date opened`,          ~`Time to fill (months)`,
  1,                    as.Date("2018-06-01"),   3,
  2,                    as.Date("2018-03-01"),   1,
  3,                    as.Date("2017-10-01"),   NA
) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Date filled` = `Date opened` + months(`Time to fill (months)`),
    `Requisition months` = coalesce(
      `Time to fill (months)`,
      lubridate::interval(`Date opened`, end2018) %/% months(1)
    ),
    `Requisition months (2018)` = if_else(
      `Date opened` > end2017,
      `Time to fill (months)`,
      `Requisition months`
      - lubridate::interval(`Date opened`, end2017) %/% months(1)
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(`Requisition ID`,
                `Date opened`,
                `Date filled`,
                everything())
ignoring_censoring <- toyexample %>%
  dplyr::select(-`Requisition months`,
                -`Requisition months (2018)`)
ignoring_censoring %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(dom = 't'))
```

---

template: toy-example

- Let's throw out the un-filled req cuz we don't know it's fill time, right?

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
onlyfilled <- ignoring_censoring %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(`Time to fill (months)`))
onlyfilled %>%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(dom = 't'))
```

--

- The .orange[**avg. time to fill**] is then just `r mean(onlyfilled[[4]])` months.

--

- The .orange[**monthly fill rate in 2018**], assuming it was constant (.controversy[LOL]): $\frac{1}{`r mean(onlyfilled[[4]])`}$<br>
(half a req filled for every month a req is open)

--

- The .orange[**annual fill rate**] is the monthly fill rate $\times$ 12 months:<br> $\frac{1}{`r mean(onlyfilled[[4]])`} \times 12 = `r 12/mean(onlyfilled[[4]])`$ reqs filled for every year a req is open

The **actual** monthly fill rate is:<br>

Which is $\frac{2}{`r paste(withoutdates[[4]], collapse = " + ")`} = \frac{2}{`r sum(withoutdates[[4]])`} = `r 2/sum(withoutdates[[4]])`$

### Time to event is usually .controversy[unknowable] with competing risks

#### Example: Promotion vs. termination

--

- If I get .teal[**terminated before my first promotion**], you'll never see how long it would have taken for me to get promoted

--

- You could guess how long it would have taken by looking at how long other people took to get promoted .orange[**assuming I'm just like them**]

--

- But I was .teal[**terminated before I got promoted**]...

--

### .center[.hero-shot[So I'm probably not like them.]]

---

# IN GENERAL

## `if:`
- The reasons that competing events occur are not independent because:

--

    - One event less likely to occur for reasons the other is likely to occur
    
--

    - Both events likely to occur for similar reasons

--

## `then:`

- Avg. time to event is **unidentified** (can't be estimated)

# .controversy[BUT BEWARE]

--

- You need to define mutually exclusive terminal events for CIFs to work

--

- CIFs aren't helpful if events can re-occur
    - 2nd, 3rd, etc. promotions and transfers

--

- CIFs assume that the event will happen someday
    - Job requisitions can get closed as filled or un-filled
    - Or hiring managers can forget to close them
    
--

- Measuring effects of interventions under competing risks is hard

---

# But rejoice

--

- Event history analysis extends to deal with all those cases with:
    - Cure models
    - Recurring event models
    - Multi-state models
